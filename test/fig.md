Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a mockup of a training module in Figma where users choose between options:

### Step 1: Set Up a Figma Account
1. **Sign Up:** If you don’t have an account, go to [Figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) and sign up for a free account.
2. **Create a New Project:**
   - Once you’re logged in, click on the **New File** button to create a new design file.

### Step 2: Create the Layout for the Training Module
1. **Set Up the Canvas:**
   - Figma works with "frames," which are essentially artboards. Press `F` on your keyboard to select the Frame tool, and then click and drag to create a frame (like a canvas) for your training module screen.
   - Alternatively, select a preset frame size from the right panel (e.g., Desktop, Mobile, or Custom Size).

2. **Design the Training Module Background:**
   - Select the **Rectangle Tool** (press `R`) and draw a rectangle to cover the background of the frame.
   - Adjust the **Fill Color** in the properties panel on the right-hand side to set a background color that fits your design.

3. **Add a Header or Title:**
   - Use the **Text Tool** (`T` on your keyboard) to add a title for the module, such as "Welcome to the Training Module" or "Choose the Correct Option."
   - Customize the font, size, and color in the right-hand properties panel.

### Step 3: Create the Question and Options
1. **Add the Question:**
   - Using the **Text Tool** (`T`), type out the question for the user. For example: "What is the capital of France?"

2. **Create Options:**
   - Use the **Rectangle Tool** (`R`) to create buttons or areas where the user will click to select an option.
   - For example, create three rectangles that will act as the options for the user to choose from.
   - Inside each rectangle, use the **Text Tool** to label the options (e.g., "Paris," "Berlin," "Madrid").

3. **Style the Buttons:**
   - Select the rectangles, and in the right panel, adjust the fill, border radius (to round the corners), and shadow if needed to create visually appealing buttons.

4. **Group the Option Text and Button:**
   - Select the text and its corresponding button, then right-click and choose **Group Selection** or press `Cmd + G` (Mac) / `Ctrl + G` (Windows). This groups the text with the button for easier movement and interaction.

### Step 4: Add Interaction (Prototyping)
1. **Create a New Frame for the Correct Choice Response:**
   - Use the **Frame Tool** (`F`) to create a second frame. This will be the screen that appears when the user selects the correct option.
   - Add a congratulatory message, such as "Correct! Paris is the capital of France."
   
2. **Create Another Frame for the Wrong Choice:**
   - Similarly, create another frame that will show when the user selects an incorrect option.
   - Add a message like "Incorrect! Try again."

3. **Link the Options to the Responses:**
   - Switch to the **Prototype** tab at the top of the right panel.
   - Click on the correct option button in the first frame, and drag the blue arrow that appears to the correct choice response frame.
   - Set the interaction to **On Click** and the action to **Navigate To** the frame where the correct response is shown.
   - Do the same for the incorrect options, linking them to the incorrect response frame.

4. **Optional: Add Animations:**
   - In the Prototype panel, you can set animations between frames (e.g., "Dissolve" or "Slide") to make the transition smoother.

### Step 5: Test the Prototype
1. **Enter Prototype Mode:**
   - Press the **Present** button (play icon) at the top-right corner of the screen to preview your prototype.
   - Click on the options to ensure they navigate to the correct frames.

### Step 6: Add Additional Features
1. **Repeat the Process:**
   - You can repeat the above steps to create additional questions or scenarios in the training module by duplicating the frames and changing the content.

2. **Navigation Buttons:**
   - Add "Next" or "Back" buttons to allow users to navigate between different training modules or retry incorrect questions.

3. **Progress Bar (Optional):**
   - You can add a progress bar at the top of the module by drawing a horizontal rectangle and adjusting its width as the user progresses through the module.

### Step 7: Share the Prototype
1. **Share the Prototype:**
   - To share the prototype with others for feedback or review, click on the **Share** button in the top-right corner.
   - You can copy a shareable link or invite collaborators to view or edit the file.

2. **Presentation Mode:**
   - When you're ready to present, use the **Present** mode to display the fully interactive mockup to others.

### Tips:
- Keep the design simple and focused on user interaction.
- Use Figma's **Auto Layout** feature to make elements responsive and easier to adjust as you design.
- Use **Components** if you want to reuse buttons or other elements across different frames.
