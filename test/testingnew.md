Got it! Since **Activities** in Salesforce are grouped under **Events** and **Tasks**, and **Activities** is not its own object, the test will focus on validating points assigned to **Task** and **Event** objects directly based on the **Fund**, **Action**, and **Type** combinations.

Here’s the revised test case, focusing on **Events** and **Tasks** for **Activity Points** validation:

---

### **Test Case: Task and Event Points Validation Based on Fund, Action, and Type**

#### **Objective**
Validate that point values are correctly assigned for **Task** and **Event** objects based on different **Funds**, **Actions**, and **Types** combinations for the **FS – Sales** profile.

---

### **Step 1: Log in to Salesforce with FS – Sales Profile**

1. **Action**: Use Testim TTA to log in as a user with the **FS – Sales** profile.
2. **Steps**:
   - Start recording a new test case.
   - Navigate to the Salesforce login page.
   - Enter the username and password of a user with the **FS – Sales** profile.
   - Click **Login**.
3. **Expected Result**: The user is successfully logged into Salesforce and directed to the homepage.

---

### **Step 2: Navigate to Task or Event Object**

1. **Action**: Navigate to the **Task** or **Event** object to create or edit a record.
2. **Steps**:
   - Click on the **App Launcher** (9 dots in the top left corner).
   - Search for **"Tasks"** or **"Events"** and click on the appropriate tab.
3. **Expected Result**: You are on the **Task** or **Event** page, where a list of current records is displayed.

---

### **Step 3: Create a New Task/Event Based on the Matrix**

1. **Action**: Create a new **Task** or **Event** using specific combinations of **Fund**, **Action**, and **Type** from the matrix.
2. **Steps**:
   - Click the **New Task** or **New Event** button.
   - Select the relevant fields based on the matrix:
     - **Fund**: Choose the appropriate fund (e.g., Private Fund).
     - **Action**: Choose an action (e.g., Scheduled Webinar Attendee).
     - **Type**: Choose a type (e.g., Sales Presentation for Task or Meeting for Event).
   - Click **Save**.
3. **Expected Result**: A new **Task** or **Event** is created with a point value assigned based on the selected combination.

---

### **Step 4: Capture the Point Value for the Task/Event**

1. **Action**: Capture the point value assigned to the **Task** or **Event**.
2. **Steps**:
   - On the details page of the **Task** or **Event**, locate the **Point Value** field.
   - Use **Get Property** in Testim to capture the point value.
   - Store the captured value in a variable (e.g., `activityPointValue`).
3. **Expected Result**: The correct point value for the **Task** or **Event** is displayed based on the selected combination.

---

### **Step 5: Validate the Point Value Using the Matrix**

1. **Action**: Validate that the captured point value matches the point value defined in the matrix for the specific combination of **Fund**, **Action**, and **Type**.
2. **Steps**:
   - Based on the matrix, manually calculate or obtain the expected point value for the selected combination.
   - Use a validation step in Testim (e.g., **Text Equals**) to compare the captured point value with the expected value.
   - Example: If the combination of **Private Fund + Scheduled Webinar Attendee + Sales Presentation** results in **24 points**, use **Text Equals** to validate that the **Point Value** is 24.
3. **Expected Result**: The **Point Value** is correct according to the matrix for the selected combination.

---

### **Step 6: Repeat for Different Fund, Action, and Type Combinations**

1. **Action**: Repeat the process to validate point values for various combinations of **Fund**, **Action**, and **Type**.
2. **Steps**:
   - Create new **Tasks** and **Events** with different combinations of:
     - **Funds** (Private Fund, Public Fund, Legacy Fund)
     - **Actions** (Scheduled Meeting, Email, etc.)
     - **Types** (Sales Presentation, Meeting, etc.)
   - Capture the point values for each combination and validate them using the matrix.
3. **Expected Result**: The point values are validated for each combination of **Fund**, **Action**, and **Type**.

---

### **Step 7: Log Out (Optional)**

1. **Action**: Log out of Salesforce after completing the test case.
2. **Steps**:
   - Click on the user profile icon in the top right corner.
   - Select **Logout**.
3. **Expected Result**: The user is logged out successfully.

---

### **Key Assertions for Validation:**

1. **Point Value Accuracy**: Ensure that the point values assigned to **Tasks** and **Events** are correct based on the matrix.
2. **Correct Combination Mapping**: Validate that the **Fund + Action + Type** combinations correctly determine the assigned points.
3. **Variable Validation**: Use Testim to compare the captured point values with the expected values from the matrix.

---

### **Summary of Matrix-Based Validation**:

1. **Task and Event Validation**: The test will focus on creating **Tasks** and **Events** with combinations of **Funds**, **Actions**, and **Types** as defined in the matrix.
2. **Dynamic Validation**: By capturing and storing the point values, you can dynamically compare them with the expected values to ensure the system calculates them correctly.
3. **Profile-Specific Testing**: The test case is designed for users with the **FS – Sales** profile, ensuring the system works correctly for that user group.

This revised test case focuses directly on **Tasks** and **Events**, ensuring that the assigned point values are correct based on the matrix of **Funds**, **Actions**, and **Types**.
