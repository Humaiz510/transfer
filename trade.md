Here’s a step-by-step test case for validating that the transaction details update as expected when a contact is changed on a transaction in **Testim TTA**.

### **Test Case: Trade Reassignment Cases**

#### **Objective**
Validate that when a contact is reassigned to a different transaction, the transaction details are updated correctly in Salesforce.

---

### **Step 1: Log in to Salesforce**

1. **Action**: Start recording in Testim TTA to automate the login.
2. **Steps**:
   - Navigate to the Salesforce login page.
   - Enter the username and password.
   - Click **Login**.
3. **Expected Result**: User is logged into Salesforce and directed to the homepage.

---

### **Step 2: Navigate to the Transactions Tab**

1. **Action**: Navigate to the **Transactions** tab to find the transaction where the contact will be reassigned.
2. **Steps**:
   - Click on the **App Launcher** (9 dots) in the top left corner.
   - Search for **"Transactions"** and click on the result.
3. **Expected Result**: You are on the **Transactions** page, where a list of transactions is displayed.

---

### **Step 3: Select the Relevant Transaction**

1. **Action**: Search for or select the transaction where you need to validate the contact reassignment.
2. **Steps**:
   - Use the search bar or scroll through the list of transactions.
   - Click on the relevant transaction to open its details page.
3. **Expected Result**: The transaction details page is displayed.

---

### **Step 4: Capture Current Transaction Details**

1. **Action**: Capture the current transaction details before the contact is changed.
2. **Steps**:
   - Identify the fields that will be affected by the contact change (e.g., **Transaction Owner**, **Transaction Amount**, **Related Contact Name**).
   - Use Testim’s validation/assertion feature to capture and store these field values.
3. **Expected Result**: The initial values of the transaction fields are recorded for comparison later.

---

### **Step 5: Change the Contact on the Transaction**

1. **Action**: Reassign the contact associated with the transaction.
2. **Steps**:
   - Find the **Contact** field on the transaction details page.
   - Click the **Edit** button to modify the contact.
   - Select a new contact from the dropdown or search for a new contact.
   - Click **Save** to update the transaction.
3. **Expected Result**: The contact is successfully reassigned to the new contact.

---

### **Step 6: Verify Transaction Details Updated**

1. **Action**: Verify that the transaction details have been updated correctly after the contact was changed.
2. **Steps**:
   - Check the fields that should have updated based on the new contact (e.g., **Transaction Owner**, **Transaction Amount**, **Related Contact Name**).
   - Use Testim’s validation/assertion feature to compare the new field values with the previous ones captured in Step 4.
3. **Expected Result**: The transaction details are updated correctly to reflect the new contact.

---

### **Step 7: Logout (Optional)**

1. **Action**: Log out of Salesforce after completing the test case.
2. **Steps**:
   - Click on the user profile icon in the top right corner.
   - Select **Logout**.
3. **Expected Result**: The user is logged out of Salesforce.

---

### **Key Assertions for Validation:**

- Ensure that after the contact is changed, the **Transaction Owner** (or any other contact-related fields) is updated to reflect the new contact.
- Verify that **Transaction Amount** and any other details tied to the contact are updated accordingly.
- Confirm no errors or discrepancies occur during the reassignment process.

---

### Additional Notes:
- **Reusable Test Steps**: You can make the login and navigation steps reusable for future test cases.
- **Dynamic Data**: Ensure that the test is flexible enough to handle different transaction and contact data.
- **Assertions**: Use assertions in Testim TTA to validate each of the transaction field updates.

This test case will help you validate that the transaction updates correctly when a contact is reassigned in Salesforce.
