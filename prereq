If your Salesforce org does not have any data (i.e., no Accounts or Contacts), you’ll need to create the required data first before testing the "Approved Funds on Account/Contact" workflow. Below is a step-by-step guide that covers everything you need to do, including creating data in Salesforce, setting up the test environment, and then building your test case in **Testim TTA**.

### Step 1: **Create Test Data (Accounts and Contacts) in Salesforce**

Since you have no Accounts or Contacts in your Salesforce org, you'll need to create them manually or programmatically. Here’s how to create them manually:

#### **Create a New Account**
1. **Log into Salesforce**: Use your Salesforce login credentials.
2. **Navigate to the "Accounts" Tab**:
   - Click on the App Launcher (9 dots in the top left).
   - Search for "Accounts" and click on it.
3. **Create a New Account**:
   - Click the **"New"** button on the Accounts page.
   - Fill in the required fields (e.g., **Account Name**, **Phone**, **Industry**).
   - Click **"Save"**.

#### **Create a New Contact**
1. **Navigate to the "Contacts" Tab**:
   - Again, go to the App Launcher and search for **"Contacts"**.
2. **Create a New Contact**:
   - Click **"New"** on the Contacts page.
   - Fill in the details like **First Name**, **Last Name**, and **Email**.
   - Associate this Contact with the Account you created by selecting it in the **"Account Name"** lookup field.
   - Click **"Save"**.

### Step 2: **Create Agreements in Salesforce (if necessary)**

If your Salesforce org includes a custom **"Agreements"** object, you need to ensure it's configured and ready for use. If there’s no custom object named **Agreements**, either:
- You need to work with your Salesforce administrator to create this custom object.
- If you're using a standard object, identify which Salesforce object represents agreements or contractual arrangements (e.g., **Opportunities**, **Orders**, or **Contracts**).

#### **Create a New Agreement (or Contract/Opportunity)**
1. **Go to the Relevant Object Tab**:
   - Navigate to the relevant tab (e.g., **Agreements**, **Opportunities**, or **Contracts**).
   - If you're working with a custom Agreements object, you might need to search for it in the App Launcher.
2. **Create a New Agreement**:
   - Click **"New"**.
   - Fill in the fields (e.g., **Agreement Name**, **Amount**, **Date**).
   - Associate this Agreement with the previously created Account.
   - Click **"Save"**.

### Step 3: **Ensure Approved Funds Field Exists**

Make sure the **"Approved Funds"** field exists on the Account or Contact object. If it does not exist, you need to create a custom field.

#### **Create a Custom Field for "Approved Funds" (if necessary)**
1. **Navigate to Setup**:
   - Click on the gear icon in the top right and go to **"Setup"**.
2. **Go to Object Manager**:
   - In Setup, find the **"Object Manager"** tab and search for **"Account"** or **"Contact"** (depending on where you need the field).
3. **Create a New Custom Field**:
   - Click **"Fields & Relationships"**.
   - Click the **"New"** button to add a new custom field.
   - Choose **Currency** or **Number** for the field type and name it **"Approved Funds"**.
   - Set the necessary visibility and permissions for different profiles.
   - Click **"Save"**.

### Step 4: **Verify Profiles and Permissions**

Ensure that the user profile you're testing has the correct permissions to view and edit the **Approved Funds** field and the associated objects (Accounts, Contacts, Agreements).

1. **Go to Setup**:
   - Click on the gear icon and go to **"Setup"**.
2. **Search for "Profiles"**:
   - In Setup, search for **"Profiles"** and click on the relevant profile assigned to your test user.
3. **Check Object Permissions**:
   - Scroll to the **"Object Settings"** section and ensure that the **Account**, **Contact**, and **Agreement** (or related object) have the necessary permissions.
   - Make sure the **Approved Funds** field is visible and editable.

### Step 5: **Test Setup in Testim TTA**

Once you’ve created the data and verified the correct fields and profiles, you can now create the test case in **Testim TTA** as follows:

#### **Login to Salesforce**
1. Record the login steps as outlined in my previous message.

#### **Navigate to the Account/Contact Tab**
1. Use the App Launcher to navigate to the **Accounts** or **Contacts** tab.
2. Click on the Account or Contact you just created.

#### **Capture the Initial Approved Funds Value**
1. Scroll to the **Approved Funds** field and capture its value using Testim’s validation/assertion feature.

#### **Create a New Agreement**
1. Navigate to the **Agreements** related list for the Account.
2. Click **"New"** and fill in the Agreement details.
3. Save the new Agreement.

#### **Navigate Back and Validate Approved Funds**
1. Go back to the Account/Contact.
2. Verify that the **Approved Funds** field is updated with the new value.

#### **Final Test Case**
1. Ensure you have assertions set up to verify both the initial and final values of **Approved Funds**.
2. Optionally, add steps to clean up the created data.

### Additional Notes:
- **Field Mapping**: Ensure the **Approved Funds** field is properly mapped to agreements/contracts so that the field updates correctly when agreements are created.
- **Data Cleanup**: In a test environment, you may want to create a cleanup step to delete the test data after the test runs.
  
This setup will allow you to run your test case in Testim TTA successfully.
