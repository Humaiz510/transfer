In Freshservice's Workflow Automator, you can integrate external services or use custom actions to automate the combination of PDFs, but this will typically involve triggering a webhook or an API call that handles the PDF merging process. Here's how you can conceptually set it up:

### Step 1: Create a Workflow Trigger for PDF Combination

1. **Set the Trigger:**
   - In Workflow Automator, you can create a new trigger based on a specific event, such as when the approval is completed (e.g., the ticket status is changed to "Approved" or "Ready for Dispatch").

2. **Add a Condition (Optional):**
   - You might want to add a condition to check if both the cash flow notice and the approval document are attached to the ticket before proceeding with the combination.

### Step 2: Trigger a Webhook to Combine PDFs

Since Freshservice doesn't natively support PDF merging, you would typically need to trigger an external service or script that handles the merging of PDFs. This is done through a webhook.

1. **Add an Action to Trigger a Webhook:**
   - In the Workflow Automator, add an action to **Trigger a Webhook**.
   - Configure the webhook to send the necessary data (e.g., ticket ID, URLs of the attached PDFs) to an external service or script that will handle the PDF merging.

   **Webhook Payload Example:**
   ```json
   {
     "ticket_id": "{{ticket.id}}",
     "attachments": [
       "{{ticket.attachments.url_1}}",
       "{{ticket.attachments.url_2}}"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **External Service or Script:**
   - The webhook should point to a server or cloud function where you have a script or service set up to download the PDFs from Freshservice, merge them, and then re-upload the combined PDF to the ticket.

   **Example Python Script (Using `PyPDF2`):**
   ```python
   import requests
   from PyPDF2 import PdfMerger

   def download_pdf(url, output_path):
       response = requests.get(url)
       with open(output_path, 'wb') as file:
           file.write(response.content)

   def merge_pdfs(pdf_list, output_path):
       merger = PdfMerger()
       for pdf in pdf_list:
           merger.append(pdf)
       merger.write(output_path)
       merger.close()

   def upload_pdf(ticket_id, file_path):
       # Add your code to upload the combined PDF back to Freshservice
       pass

   # Example usage
   pdf_urls = ['url_to_cash_flow_notice', 'url_to_approval']
   local_pdfs = ['cash_flow_notice.pdf', 'approval.pdf']

   for url, path in zip(pdf_urls, local_pdfs):
       download_pdf(url, path)

   merge_pdfs(local_pdfs, 'combined.pdf')
   upload_pdf(ticket_id, 'combined.pdf')
   ```

### Step 3: Re-upload the Combined PDF to Freshservice

1. **Upload the Combined PDF:**
   - After the PDF merging process is complete, your external script should upload the merged document back into the Freshservice ticket.

2. **Update the Ticket:**
   - You can add another action in the Workflow Automator to update the ticket status to "Ready for Dispatch" or "Completed" after the combined PDF has been uploaded.

### Step 4: Final Workflow Automation Steps

1. **Review and Test the Workflow:**
   - Ensure that the workflow correctly triggers the PDF merging process and that the combined document is uploaded to the ticket.

2. **Finalize and Save the Workflow:**
   - Once everything is working as expected, save and activate the workflow.

### Summary

To combine the cash flow PDF and the approval document within the Workflow Automator:

1. **Trigger a Webhook:** When the ticket reaches a certain status.
2. **External Script:** Use an external script or service to download, merge, and re-upload the PDFs.
3. **Re-upload to Freshservice:** The merged PDF is uploaded back into the ticket.
4. **Finalize Ticket:** Update the ticket status accordingly.

This approach leverages external tools to handle the PDF merging, with Freshservice managing the workflow logic and triggering the necessary actions.
