Here are additional, more detailed questions you can consider asking about the implementation and use of Testim for Salesforce:

### Test Creation and Management
1. **Complex Test Scenarios**
   - How can Testim help create and manage tests for complex Salesforce workflows that span multiple objects and user roles?
   - Are there any best practices for handling complex test scenarios to ensure they are maintainable and scalable?

2. **Parameterized Testing**
   - How can we create parameterized tests in Testim that can run with different sets of data inputs?
   - What are the limitations, if any, for parameterized testing within Testim for Salesforce?

3. **Reusable Components**
   - Can Testim support the creation of reusable components or modules to streamline test case creation?
   - How do we manage and update these reusable components across multiple test cases?

### Advanced Recording and Methods
4. **Handling Dynamic Elements**
