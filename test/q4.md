Here are some examples of edge scenarios or rare conditions that you might consider testing in Salesforce with Testim:

### Data Validation and Handling
1. **Boundary Value Testing**
   - Entering maximum, minimum, and just-above/below valid values in numeric fields.
   - Handling large data inputs in text fields, such as maximum character limits.

2. **Invalid Data Entry**
   - Entering special characters, SQL injection patterns, or XSS scripts in input fields.
   - Providing invalid formats for date, email, and phone number fields.

3. **Null and Empty Inputs**
   - Leaving required fields empty and attempting to submit forms.
   - Entering null values in fields that should not accept nulls and checking system behavior.

### User Interactions and Permissions
4. **Concurrent Modifications**
   - Simulating multiple users editing the same record simultaneously to check for data consistency and conflict resolution.
   - Testing for record locks and proper error messages when records are being edited by another user.

5. **Permission Boundaries**
   - Accessing records or functionalities with users having minimal permissions and verifying access controls.
   - Testing role-based access to ensure users can only perform actions permitted by their role.

### System Performance and Limits
6. **High Load and Performance Testing**
   - Uploading large files or attachments to Salesforce records.
   - Performing bulk operations such as mass updates or imports and observing system performance.

7. **Timeouts and Delays**
   - Simulating network latency or slow server responses to test application behavior under delayed conditions.
   - Checking for appropriate handling of session timeouts during long periods of inactivity.

### Data Integrity and Consistency
8. **Data Consistency Checks**
   - Testing for data consistency when records are linked across multiple objects (e.g., deleting a parent record and verifying cascading deletions or orphaned records).
   - Verifying that calculated fields update correctly based on changes in related records.

9. **Duplicate Records**
   - Entering duplicate data to test deduplication rules and error messages.
   - Checking the system’s ability to merge duplicate records correctly.

### Integration and Workflow Scenarios
10. **External System Failures**
    - Simulating failures in external systems or APIs that Salesforce integrates with to ensure proper error handling and retry mechanisms.
    - Verifying that Salesforce handles incomplete or erroneous data returned from external systems.

11. **Workflow and Trigger Anomalies**
    - Testing edge cases where multiple workflows or triggers might conflict or cause unexpected behavior.
    - Ensuring that complex workflow rules and triggers execute in the correct order and handle exceptions gracefully.

### Usability and User Interface
12. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**
    - Testing the Salesforce application across different browsers and versions to identify rendering or functionality issues.
    - Checking for responsiveness and usability on various devices and screen sizes.

13. **Localization and Internationalization**
    - Verifying the application’s behavior with different locale settings, including date formats, currency, and language translations.
    - Entering multilingual data and ensuring proper display and processing.

### Rare System States
14. **System Maintenance and Downtime**
    - Simulating system maintenance or downtime and observing how the application handles user sessions and data integrity.
    - Testing the application’s behavior during backup and restore operations.

15. **Unusual User Paths**
    - Navigating the application in unexpected ways, such as using the back button frequently, opening multiple tabs, or bookmarking deep links.
    - Verifying that the application maintains state and handles these unusual paths correctly.

These edge scenarios and rare conditions are essential for ensuring that your Salesforce implementation is robust and can handle unexpected or extreme situations gracefully.
